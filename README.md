## Project Motivations :
There are a variety of project motivations related to student stress factors that can be attributed to academic expectations, personal situations, and educational pressures.  Students are frequently impacted by the following major motivators and stressors:
1. Pressure to Perform Academically: Stress and worry are brought on by the requirement for high marks to guarantee future possibilities.
2. Time management: It might be difficult to balance job, school, and personal obligations, which can cause stress.
3. Exam and Assignment Deadlines: Strict timelines and exam schedules put students under strain and cause them to feel overwhelmed.
4. Family standards: When ambitions clash with personal interests, the pressure to live up to family standards can be stressful.
5. Adapting to New Environments: It can be challenging for first-year students in particular to adjust to new academic settings.
