## Project Motivations:
Examining student stress data provides important information about the primary stressors, including social, economic, and academic aspects. It advances knowledge of stress and aids in the identification of its various effects on students' lives, benefiting education and psychology, among other fields. Along with providing useful stress-reduction strategies, like time management and exercise, this research also makes it possible to offer focused remedies, like financial assistance or counseling services. It also improves the analytical and statistical abilities of researchers, which advances their academic and professional development.
