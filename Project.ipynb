"Identify Key Stress Factors: To determine the main contributors to student stress, such as academic workload, social life, and financial concerns.\n \nAnalyze Correlations: To explore how different stressors interact, like the impact of financial pressures on academic stress or the role of social support in alleviating stress.\n \nPredict Impact: To assess how stress factors influence academic performance and well-being, identifying critical points where stress begins to negatively affect students.\n \nDevelop Interventions: To design targeted solutions like time management workshops or financial aid based on identified stress factors.\n \nEnhance Learning Environments: To create healthier, more supportive educational environments by reducing stress through data-driven strategies.\n",
